**A [website](https://rocker-org.github.io/website) for the Rocker Project**

Carl Boettiger & Dirk Eddelbuettel

Website is currently under development and probably not suitable for active deployment yet.  
The goal of this site is to provide a more visible landing page for the project and a central
reference for common tasks.  This should complement the wiki as a more accessible set of 
documentation for the basic stuff.  

Feedback & contributions welcome.

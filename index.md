## 🚀Getting Started

Ensure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and start R inside a container with:

```sh
docker run --rm -ti r-base
```

Or get started with an RStudio® instance:

```sh
docker run --rm -ti -e PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 8787:8787 rocker/rstudio
```

and point your browser to `localhost:8787`. Log in with user/password `rstudio`/`yourpassword`.

For more information and further options, see [the image descriptions](images).
